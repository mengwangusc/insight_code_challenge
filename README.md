Some comments:
1. I used Java to program this coding challenge.
2. All input file and output files are hardcoded in codeChallenge.java.
3. I didn't use any specical software or library. All libraries used are defalt Java libraries.
4. There are 5 java files. main function is in codeChallenge.java file. Other 4 files are Host.java, Resource.java, Hour.java, HostAttempt.java which stand for 4 useful classes used in codeChallenge.java.
5. run.sh: first, cd src; second, javac codeChallenge.java; third, java codeChallenge
6. There are no input or output argument in command line.
7. Since the input file given is too large, I extracted its first 7000 lines and put them in log.txt file and my own test case.
8. All Java files are well documented and explained briefly about what data structure to be used and what is the algorithm.
9. All 4 features are well achieved and all test cases are passed
